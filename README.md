# RunRun
side-scrolling experiment

inspired by https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-make-an-infinitely-scrolling-game-with-phaser/

This uses Phaser CE 2.8.6

Originally, I was going touse this to create my new sidescrolling game. I will but I want to set this asside as a template for future game development.
